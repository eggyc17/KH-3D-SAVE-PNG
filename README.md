to make the game register the save data :
find whatecver file the shortcut of the game comes from - this can be done by right- clicking the shortcut, then 'open file location'.
once open, PUT IN ORDER OF: DOCUMENTS-> KH HD 2.8 FINAL CHAPTER PROLOGUE-> EPIC GAMES STORE->1638->PUT IN HERE
all done! this can also be done for kh3, and others.
this is a useful to transfer data on different laptops WITHOUT losing your progress, although it will have to be updated frequently to avoid confusion, or possible data loss.
